dictionary.c is part of a bigger programm called speller.c, which implements the complete functionality of a spell-checker. Our task was to write the functions in dictionary.c to complete the functionalities, mainly loading the dictionary into memory (using a hash table), checking if a word in a text is inside the dictionary and unloading the dict from memory.
